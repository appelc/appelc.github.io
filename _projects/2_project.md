The extensive monitoring network for northern spotted owls in the Pacific Northwest provides an incredible opportunity to survey for a wide variety of additional animal species. We have deployed remote camera traps along with acoustic recorders at over 400 sites in the Oregon Coast Range and are testing a paired design including both ground- and trail-facing cameras to detect small and large mammals, respectively.

I've also developed a computer vision workflow to detect and classify animals in images from both ground and trail cameras. More coming soon!
