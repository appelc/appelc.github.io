I am extremely fortunate to get to work with collaborators from African Parks and the U.S. Forest Service on a large monitoring program in Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, which was the site of the largest-ever translocation of African elephants in 2016 and 2017. To date, over 2000 animals of 9 species have been released into the reserve as part of the restoration effort.

We are using remote camera traps to monitor mammal populations in the reserve, along with computer vision models to process the data. More coming soon!

This project was a driving factor behind the development of Njobvu-AI, a user-friendly software tool to label images and train custom computer vision models, developed with collaborators at Oregon State University.
