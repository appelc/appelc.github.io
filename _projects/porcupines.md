I studied North American porcupines for my master's thesis at Cal Poly Humboldt with Dr. Tim Bean. We conducted a field study that involved radio-collaring and tracking porcupines in the Tolowa Dunes of northern coastal California to learn about their <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/99/5/1159/5052414">resource selection strategies</a> in this part of their range.

Porcupine populations are suspected to be declining in western North America, so we also collected occurrence records to track their historical and contemporary distribution in <a href="https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=oer">northern California</a>, where porcupines are now listed as a Species of Special Concern, and then expanded this effort into <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cara-Appel/publication/349951521_NORTH_AMERICAN_PORCUPINE_DISTRIBUTION_IN_THE_PACIFIC_NORTHWEST_AND_EVALUATION_OF_A_NON-INVASIVE_MONITORING_TECHNIQUE/links/620c0714634ff774f4cfb401/NORTH-AMERICAN-PORCUPINE-DISTRIBUTION-IN-THE-PACIFIC-NORTHWEST-AND-EVALUATION-OF-A-NON-INVASIVE-MONITORING-TECHNIQUE.pdf">Oregon and Washington</a>.
