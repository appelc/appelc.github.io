I am a PhD student in Wildlife Science at Oregon State University. My dissertation research focuses on applications of machine learning to wildlife research and conservation, including bioacoustics for monitoring northern spotted owls and computer vision methods with camera traps for monitoring mammal communities. Previously I studied habitat ecology and distribution of North American porcupines in the Pacific Northwest.
