I am a PhD candidate in Wildlife Science at Oregon State University. My dissertation research focuses on applications of machine learning to wildlife research and conservation, including <a href="/_projects/bioacoustics">bioacoustics</a> for monitoring northern spotted owls and <a href="/projects/oregon_critters">computer vision</a> methods with camera traps for monitoring <a href="/projects/nkhotakota_camera_traps">mammal communities</a>. Previously I studied habitat ecology and distribution of North American <a href="/projects/porcupines">porcupines</a> in the Pacific Northwest.
